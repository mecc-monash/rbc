## How it Works? 

### H-bridge 

A H-Bridge is a circuit which we can use to control the direction of a DC motor. It contains four switching elements (transistors) which form a H-like configuation. The switching elements form "complementary" pairs which allows the direction of current flow to the motor to be reversed.

The L298N is a dual H-Bridge motor driver which allows both the speed and direction of two DC-motors to be controlled at the same time. But wait a minute, speed? 

### Pulse Width Modulation

Pulse width modulation or PWM can be used to control the speed of an input voltage
